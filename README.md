### üì∏ 01-ImageScaling.py 
**Purpose:** Batch image rescaling tool with full preservation of EXIF, GPS, and spectral metadata. 
<p align="justify">This script provides a graphical interface for batch scaling of TIFF and standard image files. It resizes images to user-defined dimensions using OpenCV and `tifffile`, while maintaining metadata integrity via ExifTool. A minimalist GUI built with CustomTkinter enables quick and intuitive dataset preprocessing prior to YOLO model training.</p>

### üìÅ 02-Organization_of_data_sets.py
**Purpose:** Interactive multispectral dataset builder and splitter for YOLO training pipelines.
<p align="justify">This script provides a GUI-based tool for validating, organizing, and splitting multispectral image‚Äìlabel pairs into structured YOLO datasets. It automatically scans subfolders for matching spectral channels (RGB, G, R, RE, NIR), verifies annotation consistency, detects duplicates or missing files, and partitions the data into *train/validation/test* sets by user-defined percentages. Files are moved into a standardized YOLO directory tree (`/images` and `/labels` per spectral band), and a detailed CSV report is generated. The interface offers real-time visual summaries and validation feedback, enabling reliable preprocessing for multispectral deep learning experiments.</p>

### üß† 03-Training.py
**Purpose:** Script for training YOLO-based object detection models on multispectral or RGB datasets.
<p align="justify">This script automates the setup and execution of model training using the Ultralytics YOLO framework. It validates the environment configuration (Python, CUDA, PyTorch, cuDNN, GPU availability), verifies YOLO dataset structure integrity, and generates a `data.yaml` file defining training, validation, and test paths. The training loop is executed with user-defined hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, optimizer, learning rates), enabling reproducible experimentation across YOLOv8, YOLO11, and YOLO12 architectures. Training results ‚Äî including metrics, weights, and logs ‚Äî are automatically saved to organized `runs/train_*` directories.</p>

### üßÆ 04-Model_evaluation_using_test_set.py
**Purpose:** Automated model evaluation and metric extraction on the YOLO test set.
<p align="justify">This script evaluates trained YOLO models on the designated *test split*, computing key performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, mAP@0.5, and mAP@[.5:.95]. It verifies CUDA availability, loads the model and dataset configuration (`data.yaml`), and executes the evaluation on GPU with full metric logging. Results are saved both as CSV (`metrics_summary_testset.csv`) and JSON (`predictions_testset.json`), while annotated test images with bounding boxes are automatically exported. The pipeline ensures reproducible benchmark evaluation for each spectral or RGB model configuration, supporting both desktop (RTX 5080) and embedded (Jetson Orin NX) environments.</p>
